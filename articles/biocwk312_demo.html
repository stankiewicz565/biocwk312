<p>List “big picture” student-centered workshop goals and learning objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make these as precise and accurate as possible.</p>
<p><em>Learning goals</em> are high-level descriptions of what participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is over. <em>Learning objectives</em>, on the other hand, describe in very specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge attained. The <a href="#bloom">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> may be a useful framework for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there are others.</p>

<p>Visualization of genomic data is closely linked to annotation. Annotation can be unwieldy and cumbersome to interrogate. We have collected some slices of genomic data and annotation to help with exploration of new approaches to interactive visualization in reports.</p>
<p><strong>Reference positions of transcripts</strong>. We have information on a selection of transcripts on chromosome 17 in the vicinity of gene ORMDL3.</p>

<p><strong>Positions and annotation of GWAS hits</strong>. We used the <code>gwascat</code> package to get a copy of the EBI/EMBL GWAS catalog on 1 November 2020, and limited the information to records pertaining to the interval 38-43 Mb on chr17. We also limited the number of metadata fields on the hits.</p>

<p><strong>An interactive visualization of GWAS hits and nearby genes.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll use the TnT package along with some functions built for the workshop to visualize GWAS hit locations in the context of transcripts.</p>
<p>The display below is interactive. Clicking the mouse or trackpad near the middle will zoom in. A mouse wheel will also control zoom. At greater magnifications, annotations will be displayed, or you can click on a feature to get textual annotation. You can drag the display left or right after magnification. To restore initial state, reload the page in the browser.</p>

hit on chr17 between positions 39,932,000 and 39,934,000. Use zoom and drag to find it. What is the rs number for the SNP, what is the disease/trait with which this SNP is associated, and what is the risk allele frequency? These can be determined by clicking on the head of the blue pin plotted in the interval given.</p>
