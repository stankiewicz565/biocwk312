## Overview

### Description

This document is a technical illustration of how workshop documents
are authored and rendered.  The content _of this document_ will change completely
as the workshop content is specified.

### Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* Familiarity with Rstudio
* Basic understanding of modern genomics.  For example, the distinction
between whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq should be clear.
* Basic familiarity with the concepts of statistical analysis, such
as the definition of the t-test for comparing sample means, the
interpretation of histograms.  An understanding of experimental design
is helpful.
* Readings:


### Participation

Describe how students will be expected to participate in the workshop.

### _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

List any _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages that will be explicitly covered.

### Time outline

An example for a 45-minute workshop:

| Activity                     | Time |
|------------------------------|------|
| Brief intro to R/Rstudio     | 10m  |
| Biological context           | 10m  |
| Packages to be used          | 10m  |
| Analytical approach to the question | 15m   |
| Simple exercises               | 10m  |
| Review               | 5m  |

### Workshop goals and objectives

List "big picture" student-centered workshop goals and learning
objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the
same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide
whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make
these as precise and accurate as possible.

*Learning goals* are high-level descriptions of what
participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is
over. *Learning objectives*, on the other hand, describe in very
specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge
attained. The [Bloom's Taxonomy](#bloom) may be a useful framework
for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there
are others.

### Learning goals

Some examples:

* describe how to...
* identify methods for...
* understand the difference between...

### Learning objectives

* analyze xyz data to produce...
* create xyz plots
* evaluate xyz data for artifacts

## Workshop

Divide the workshop into sections (`## A Section`). Include
fully-evaluated _R_ code chunks. Develop exercises and solutions, and
anticipate that your audience will walk through the code with you, or
work on the code idependently -- do not be too ambitious in the
material that you present.
